# YouTube-API-Analysis

## Overview
This project involves extracting basic details of educational YouTube channels, specifically focusing on channels like BeerBiceps, Nitish Rajput, Raj Shamani, Abhi and Niyua and warikoo. The data is collected using the Google API service for YouTube (v3). The analysis includes visualization and an in-depth examination of the BeerBiceps channel.

## Files Included
YT API Analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data extraction, visualization, and analysis. BeerBiceps_VideoDetails.csv: CSV file containing the extracted data for the BeerBiceps YouTube Channel from the YouTube API.

## Contents
### 1. Introduction
In this project, we aim to analyze several educational YouTube channels to gain insights into their performance, content, and audience engagement. We utilize the Google API service for YouTube (v3) to gather data on channels such as BeerBiceps, Nitish Rajput, Raj Shamani, Abhi and Niyua and warikoo.

### 2. Function for Channel Statistics
We have implemented a function to retrieve statistics for each channel, including metrics such as subscriber count, view count, and video count. This function utilizes the YouTube API to fetch the necessary data.

### 3. Function for Video IDs Retrieval
Another crucial function implemented in this project is for retrieving video IDs associated with each channel. These video IDs are essential for further analysis and visualization of video-specific metrics.

### 4. Data Visualization
We leverage Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to create visualizations based on the extracted data. Visualizations include bar plots, pie charts, and scatter plots to illustrate subscriber counts, view counts, and other relevant metrics for the selected YouTube channels.

### 5. Analysis of BeerBiceps Channel
A significant portion of the analysis is dedicated to exploring the BeerBiceps channel in detail. We delve into factors such as subscriber growth over time, popular video topics, engagement metrics, and any notable trends or patterns observed.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the performance and content strategies of educational YouTube channels. The functions developed facilitate efficient data extraction and analysis, while the visualizations offer a comprehensive understanding of channel metrics and trends.
